# {{ slug }}

This is a sample project, generated by [docker-compose-nodejs-examples](https://github.com/b00giZm/docker-compose-nodejs-examples), to help you getting started with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and Node.js.

## Requirements

You need, of course, recent versions of Docker and Docker Compose installed. Please refer to the [original documention on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to see how to install them on your system.

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) should also be available on your system. If you have any build tools installed, chances are pretty good that `make` is already present on your machine.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd /path/to/{{ slug }}
make
```

Depending on the project layout, it might take a few minutes to compile, build and start the app. When done, you can access the app in your browser. On macOS and Linux, this should be [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
